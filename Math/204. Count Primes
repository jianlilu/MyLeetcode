Description:

Count the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative number, n.

Hint:

Let's start with a isPrime function. To determine if a number is prime, we need to check if it is not divisible by any number less than n. The runtime complexity of isPrime function would be O(n) and hence counting the total prime numbers up to n would be O(n2). Could we do better?

As we know the number must not be divisible by any number > n / 2, we can immediately cut the total iterations half by dividing only up to n / 2. Could we still do better?

Let's write down all of 12's factors:

2 × 6 = 12
3 × 4 = 12
4 × 3 = 12
6 × 2 = 12
As you can see, calculations of 4 × 3 and 6 × 2 are not necessary. Therefore, we only need to consider factors up to √n because, if n is divisible by some number p, then n = p × q and since p ≤ q, we could derive that p ≤ √n.

Our total runtime has now improved to O(n1.5), which is slightly better. Is there a faster approach?

public int countPrimes(int n) {
   int count = 0;
   for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      if (isPrime(i)) count++;
   }
   return count;
}

private boolean isPrime(int num) {
   if (num <= 1) return false;
   // Loop's ending condition is i * i <= num instead of i <= sqrt(num)
   // to avoid repeatedly calling an expensive function sqrt().
   for (int i = 2; i * i <= num; i++) {
      if (num % i == 0) return false;
   }
   return true;
}
The Sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient ways to find all prime numbers up to n. But don't let that name scare you, I promise that the concept is surprisingly simple.

We start off with a table of n numbers. Let's look at the first number, 2. We know all multiples of 2 must not be primes, so we mark them off as non-primes. Then we look at the next number, 3. Similarly, all multiples of 3 such as 3 × 2 = 6, 3 × 3 = 9, ... must not be primes, so we mark them off as well. Now we look at the next number, 4, which was already marked off. What does this tell you? Should you mark off all multiples of 4 as well?



public class Solution {
    public int countPrimes(int n) {
        boolean[] isMarked = new boolean[n];
        for(int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            if(!isMarked[i]) {
                for(int j = i * 2; j < n; j = j + i) {
                    if(!isMarked[j]) {
                        isMarked[j] = true;    
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            if(!isMarked[i]) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
